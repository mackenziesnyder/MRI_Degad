*This package is under active development. It should be stable and reproducible, but please let any of the active contributing members know if there are any bugs or unusual behaviour.*

This Python package is a standard 3D [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) (Ronneberger et al. 2015) machine learning model based on Snakemake and SnakeBIDS workflow management tools, trained on a database containing gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI and non-gadolinium T1-weighted scans. It is currently in development phase and contains tunable parameters that are not normally exposed in most other machine learning models; the user is highly advised to get familiar with the above mentioned workflow managaments tools and read docstrings and relevant documentation before using this software.

## Workflow

A brief summary of the workflow can be found below along with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (see documentation for a detailed summary):

![Alt text](docs/workflow/dag.svg)

1. Preprocess input NIfTI T1w gadolinium enhanced files (n4 bias correction, isotropic 1mm voxel resampling)
2. Download and apply the Degad model
