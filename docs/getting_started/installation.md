# Installation

To install the app, first install `uv`. On macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, run:
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Alternatively, you can install it from PyPI using:

```
pip install uv
```

or with pipx:

```
pipx install uv
```

Once uv is installed, create and activate a virtual environment:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the package in editable mode:

```
uv pip install -e .
```

# Running the app

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```
mri_degad -h
```

This should display the help message for the CLI. If it doesnâ€™t, ensure that your virtual environment is activated and that the installation completed without errors.

To use the BIDS App, run:

```
mri_degad /path/to/bids/dataset /path/to/output/derivatives participant --cores all
```

Replace /path/to/bids/dataset with the path to your BIDS-compliant input dataset and /path/to/output/derivatives with the desired output directory.

If you're developing the app and want to install development dependencies such as linters and formatters, please refer to the instructions in the [Contributing](../contributing/contributing.md) page.

# Dry-run / testing your workflow

Using Snakemake\'s dry-run option (`--dry-run`/`-n`) is an easy way to verify
any changes made to the workflow are working direcctly. The `tests/data` folder 
contains a _fake_ BIDS dataset (i.e. dataset with zero-sized files) that is 
useful for verifying different aspects of the workflow. These dry-run tests are 
part of the automated Github actions that are run for every commit.

```
mri_degad tests/data /test/data/derivatives participant --cores all -n
```

This performs the baseline test, in which a user
may use mri_degad.
